#  Python only has 2 variants of loops: while and for

# cities = ["Almaty", "Taraz", "Nur-Sultan", "Shymkent"]
# index = 0
# while index < len(cities):
#     print(cities[index])
#     index = index + 1                   # Python doesn't have ++ operator

# OR

# for city in cities:
#     print(city)
